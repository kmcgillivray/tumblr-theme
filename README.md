# [kevinschmevin.com](http://kevinschmevin.com) Tumblr Theme

This is the Tumblr theme I use on kevinschmevin.com. If you end up cloning it and using it let me know.

## Notes

I am using Typekit to load a specific font so that will break if you use it! I'd recommend [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com) if you don't have a Typekit membership.

## To do

- [ ] Move CSS to external stylesheet now that Tumblr supports that.
- [ ] Upload custom sized profile image to Tumblr now that Tumblr supports that.
